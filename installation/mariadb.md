# MySQL/MariaDB file transfer
**1:** Install PlaceholderAPI and download the vault extension.
**2:** Setup MariaDB and connect each server to the database.
**3:** Replace some vault placeholders with UPerms placeholders, 
       and add BungeeCord permissions to any users/groups needed.
**4:** Import old UPerms from files using `/upc transfer files mysql`.
**5:** Reconnect the server that you just imported the old commands on to the MariaDB.
**6:** And finally, restart everything and you're done!
