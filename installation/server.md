# Server installation
First step is to download Ultra Permissions. 

When you're done with this, `Stop your server`, and put the .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.

After the .jar has been uploaded in your folder, you can `Start your server`.
<br>

Once your server has started, a new folder called Ultra Permissions should be created, inside the `plugins` directory. 

This means that Ultra Permissions has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>

## Testing the plugin
While your server is starting, look in the console for any possible [ERROR] message. Any [WARN] is not a problem, and will not disturb the usage of the plugin.

You should now be able to use the command `/uperms` to open the GUI.


If you see a GUI, that means you are good to go!
<br>

`NOTE:` *Make sure to make yourself super admin with the command `upc AddSuperAdmin <Player>` inside the console! Or you will not be able to use the plugin.*
