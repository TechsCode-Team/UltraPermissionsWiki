# Import
With Ultra Permissions you can migrate data from LuckPerms. Before starting the migration process you need to install **Ultra Permissions** and **LuckPerms** in your server. After you have installed both plugins, connect to your server in-game, and run the command `/uperms` in chat.
<br>

Then click on the End Portal for start the migration process.
<br>

After you got kicked, you need to stop the server and delete the **LuckPerms.jar** File and the **LuckPerms** Folder. Then you can start your server again and run the command `/uperms` in chat. Click on the Bookshelf (Called `Groups`) and check if all your groups and permissions have been successfully transferred.
<br>

**`NOTE:` Make sure to make yourself super admin with the command `upc AddSuperAdmin <Player>` inside the console! Or you will not be able to use `/uperms`.**
