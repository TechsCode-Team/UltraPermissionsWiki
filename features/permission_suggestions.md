6. Now you can see the permissions that UltraPermissions offer for your chosen plugin.
<br>

*Here's a shortend version of the above guide:*
`/uperms >> Groups >> [Group] >> View Permissions >> [Plugin]`
<br>

### **NOTES:**
* `[Group]` is the group that you need to choose yourself from your group list
* `[Plugin]` is the plugin that you need to choose yourself from your plugin list
* The permissions suggestions work with players too - Just follow the guide above 
  and instead of selecting **Groups** in the second step, select **Users**
<br>

## Permission storage
If you're wondering where do UltraPermissions take the plugin permissions from, here is your answer:
- First it looks into our **Permission database** and search for the permissions related to your installed plugins
- If some permissions are not found in the Permission database, it looks into your server's plugin.yml file 
  and searches for the permissions there
- If both ways result in some permissions not being found, they are not displayed in the UltraPermissions GUI
<br>

- **But if you don't see some permissions in the plugin's GUI, you can add them manually to** [our database](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginPermissions) **or add them manually In-Game** *(See the `Guide Above`)*
