# Temporary Permissions
- You can assign permissions for a certain time to groups/players
- **You need to make yourself `SuperAdmin` to be able to work with the plugin!**
<br>

## Navigation
- It is quite simple, you only need 1 command
<br>

### **Assign to Player:** `/upc AddPlayerPermission [user] [permission] [time]`
<br>

### **Assign to Group:** `/upc AddGroupPermission [group] [permission] [time]`
<br>

### Notes:
- Replace `[group]` with the group name from your group list
- Replace `[user]` with the player nickname from your player list
<br>

- Replace `[permission]` with the permission node you want to assign
- Replace `[time]` with a number and time unit depending on 
  how long you want the group/player to have the permission
