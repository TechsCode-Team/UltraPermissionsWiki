# Server installation
Once you have downloaded the latest version of Ultra Permissions, put its .jar file inside the `plugins` directory of your server.
<br>

**``NOTE:`` Make sure to stop the server before doing this.**
<br>

Once the .jar has been uploaded, you can now start your server.
<br>

When your server has been started there should be a new folder called Ultra Permissions. This means that Ultra Permissions has loaded properly and can now be used.
<br>

## Testing the plugin
If you have followed the steps above the plugin is now running. 
You can now use `/uperms` and start making your groups.
<br>

**``NOTE:`` Make sure to make yourself super admin with the command `upc AddSuperAdmin <Player>` inside the console!**
