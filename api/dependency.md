# Dependency Information
## Maven
<br>

```xml
<repository>
        <id>techscode</id>
        <url>https://repo.techscode.com/repository/maven-releases/</url>
    </repository>
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.TechsCode</groupId>
    <artifactId>UltraPermissionsAPI</artifactId>
    <version>uperms-get-latest-version</version>
</dependency>
```
<br>

## Gradle
<br>

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
      name = 'TechsCodeAPI'
        url = 'https://repo.techscode.com/repository/maven-releases/'
    }
}
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'me.TechsCode:UltraPermissionsAPI:uperms-get-latest-version'
}
```
<br>

## Obtaining the instance
Once you have imported the API (see [Dependency](./api/dependency)), you must gain an instance of the API. 
This can be done by using:
```
UltraPermissionsAPI api = UltraPermissions.getAPI();
```
<br>

Note: It is reccomended to add UltraPermissions to the softdepend or depend section in plugin.yml, depending on your use.
