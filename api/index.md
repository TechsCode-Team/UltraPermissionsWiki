# Overview
This page contains a detailed guide on how to use our API.

<br>

## Obtaining the instance
Once you have imported the API (see [Dependency](./api/dependency)), you must gain an instance of the API. 
This can be done by using:
```
UltraPermissionsAPI api = UltraPermissions.getAPI();
```
<br>

Note: It is reccomended to add UltraPermissions to the softdepend or depend section in plugin.yml, depending on your use.
