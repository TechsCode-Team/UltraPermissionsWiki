* **`Does it support offline-mode?`**
  No, Ultra Permissions Doesn't support offline mode because we store the user data via UUID.

* **`What can I do if one of my plugin isn't listed in the gui?`**
  The best thing to do, is to [submit your plugin](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginPermissions/pulls) and its permissions following [this method](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginPermissions#contribute-permissions). Or       if you don't want to wait until your plugin is added, you can add them manually.
